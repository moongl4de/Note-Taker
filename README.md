# Note-Taker

## Description

This is a team profile generator created using Express and Node.js. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this not knowing a ton about Express, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or check out the deployed application here: [Note Taker on Heroku](https://the-best-note-taker-ever.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies Utilized

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

## Information, Important Notes, etc

I started building this application at a time when I was just getting my feet wet with Express and while I'm sure it could be written more elegantly, I'm really proud of how it turned out.

“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
